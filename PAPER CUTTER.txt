*How to use the paper cutter*

• Always place the cutter on a flat surface to prevent movement.

• Position the cutting head to the right hand side of the trimmer before inserting material.

• Insert your material to the left hand side of the trimmer, placing the work under the clear clampstrip (to
ensure a square cut). Butt your work up to the side and position the cursor to the desired measurement.

• Slide the cutting head right to left to smoothly cut through your work, replacing the cutting head to the right
hand side before removing your work to ensure a clean cut edge.

• NEVER exceed the recommended cut capacity for the trimmer - this may lead to overloading and could effect the
warranty of the trimmer.
